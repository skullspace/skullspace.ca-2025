## Membership Approval Process

When a new member applies to join SkullSpace, we initiate a two-week consultation period where SkullSpace members have the opportunity to raise any questions or concerns they may have about the new member. After that period, the Board of Directors makes a decision to approve or not approve the new membership application.

We’ve only ever had to reject one application, so don’t worry! We’re looking forward to welcoming you.
