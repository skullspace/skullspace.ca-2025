# Our spaceWork, socialize, learn 

* * *

##### SkullSpace is located in a 2,500 sq. ft. space on the second floor of 374 Donald Street, in the heart of the exchange. We’re happy to be in a central location where our members have quick and easy access to all we have to offer!

## A variety of spaces

* * *

* * *

SkullSpace is arranged to facilitate activities that appeal to everyone from our members involved in internet security to our food hackers. At the hackerspace you’ll find such diverse areas as:

  * Classroom – This is where we hold workshops, events, and talks. You can also rent it out!
  * Electronics workbench – We’ve got space for soldering stations and a massive wall of electrical components just waiting for your next project.
  * 3D printer station – With a variety of different materials available, come play with our 3D printer and realize your 3D designs.
  * CNC machine – Watch out for woodchips! The CNC machine is your next stop for all sorts of wood-based manufacturing.
  * Lounge – Our lounge is always the hotspot of the space, especially on movie nights! Check our calendar to see when the next event is happening and come join us.
  * Kitchen – Got some interesting recipes you want to try, or just looking to fix a snack? Our kitchen also has a selection of food for purchase, in case you get the munchies while hacking.

## The classroom

* * *

Our classroom is adjustable, meaning you can configure the tables, chairs, and even walls to fit the event. We’ve located the classroom at the entrance to SkullSpace so that events are easy to access and can be held without disturbing the rest of the space.

At the front of the space we also have a bicycle storage rack and mini repair station for when that itch to join a bike jam simply overwhelms! We’ve even got a few bicycles that members can rent.

## Electronics workbench

* * *

We’ve been very fortunate over the years to amass a huge collection of electronic parts and tools for members to use in their projects. At the workbench you’ll find:

  * Hakko 808 Desoldering Gun
  * Saleae Logic 8 Digital Analyzer
  * Hand tools including pliers, wire cutters, and all the tools required for electronics work

## CNC machine

Our CNC is an Inventables X-Carve with a 1m x 1m workable area.

You can carve any design you program using our step-by-step instructions. We carve every Tuesday, so come on out!

## Lounge

The lounge is where we host movie nights, play games, or just hang out. We’ve got a great surround sound system and projector to round off a full-service multimedia setup. We also have a desktop computer connected to the system!

## Kitchen

* * *

Our kitchen is small but useful for meal prep and food hacking. It comes with the standard complement of kitchen equipment – just remember to clean up after yourself!

We stock a variety of food and drink that’s available for purchase, just in case you get the munchies while hacking.
