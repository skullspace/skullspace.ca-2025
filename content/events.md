  * Double-Feature Movie Night ( The Watch / The 'Burbs ) **Double-Feature Movie Night ( The Watch / The 'Burbs )** 2025-11-21 19:30 \- 2025-11-22 00:50  
Skullspace, 374 Donald St 2nd Floor, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2J3, Canada Psst.. Over Here! Look, I am well aware that it isn't normal to be crouched here in the bushes in the middle of the night but I had to remind you to come to SkullSpace at 7:30PM this Friday the 21st for another Double-Feature Drive-In Movie Night. I guess you can always watch the closed circuit feed at <http://skullspace.fullspeed.tv> but you'll have to use your favourite media player. Check it out, I made this to hang up around the neighbourhood --> <https://imgta.co/i/63aUirI.jpg> Customers are behaving strangely at the local Costco. When his coworker is attacked on the job, Ben Stiller ( Simple Jack, Scorcher VI ) wastes no time in gathering a group of community-minded individuals to patrol his local streets. The only problem is that he is the only one that seems to be taking this sort of thing seriously. Perhaps the sweet new jackets will pull the team together and give them that much needed energy. The new neighbours are creepy. Every time Tom Hanks ( Mazes & Monsters, Cloud Atlas ) looks creepily out his window at their house he sees them looking creepily out of theirs at him. He looked through their trash but didn't find anything creepy. He even invited himself over so he could sneak around and case their house but they just offered him snacks. He's bound to find the creep in the neighbourhood if he looks hard enough. 7:30PM - The Watch ( <https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/80035> )  
9:15PM - Intermission  
9:30PM - The 'Burbs ( <https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/11974> ) [See more details](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=NXR0bmRxMGwxZzFlbGI2cWVqaHFyYW9tdHYgc2VydmljZUBza3VsbHNwYWNlLmNh&ctz=America/Winnipeg)
